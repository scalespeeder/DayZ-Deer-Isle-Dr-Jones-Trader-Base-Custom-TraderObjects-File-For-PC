Limited Testing on PC Deer Isle Local Server DAYZ Version 1.20 May 2023.

Trader & .dze Files Created by @scalespeeder . Please report bugs & errors to scalespeeder@gmail.com with screenshots.

Included in the file are "commented-out" extra trader NPC's and trader positions, so you can add custome traders (for helis, black-market, etc.)

Included in the repository is my DayZ Editor Mod .dze file, which you could use to customise the trader - you would
need to re-export as json and then convert to Dr Jones Trader mod format.
